Title: Nuclear Protein Prediction Using PSSM and Pseudo Amino Acid Composition

Abstract: Accurate prediction of nuclear protein is important to identify the novel proteins which might affect the genome regulation. Using the DeepLoc dataset, we trained and tested a random forest classifier for predicting nuclear protein. The features of the random forest classifier include the pse-PSSM (calculated from PSSM), amino acid composition and pseudo amino acid composition.
